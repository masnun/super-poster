Super Poster
============

### What does it do? ###

The application allows you to post to multiple facebook groups at a time.


### Setting Up ###

* Create a new Facebook application. Edit `index.html` to change the Facebook `appId`. Facebook apps allow permissions based on domains. So if you don't update the appId with your own app's ID, it will not work. 

* Please update `channelUrl` to reflect the full URL of `channel.html` file. For example: If you host super poster on http://super-poster.net, then set it like:

		
		channelUrl: 'http://super-poster.net/channel.html
	
	
That should work :)
